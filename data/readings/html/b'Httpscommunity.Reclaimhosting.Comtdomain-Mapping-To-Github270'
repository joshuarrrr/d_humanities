        <h3>A Records vs. CNAME Records</h3>

<p>When you are mapping a domain on GitHub pages (or on any site really) an important concept you want to try and wrap your head around is the difference between A Records and CNAME Records. I’m getting closer to full comprehension, but a little help never hurts so I took the following definition from <a href="https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/differences-a-cname-records/">DNS Simple</a>:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record/">A record</a> points a name to a specific IP. For example, if you want blog.dnsimple.com to point to the server 185.31.17.133 you will configure:</p>

<blockquote><p>blog.dnsimple.com. A 185.31.17.133</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/cname-record/">CNAME record</a> points a name to another name, instead of an IP. The CNAME source represents an alias for the target name and inherits its entire resolution chain. Let’s take our blog as example:</p>

<blockquote><p>blog.dnsimple.com. CNAME aetrion.github.io.</p></blockquote>

<p>To summarize, an <strong>A record</strong> points a name to an IP. <strong>CNAME record</strong> can point a name to another CNAME...</p>

<p>It’s good practice to point domains using <strong>CNAME records</strong> when possible because IP addresses can change, and when they do an A Record will break because it is hardcoded. You might think of CNAME records as relative hostnames, hence the IP address can change regularly but the mapped domain will not break.</p>

<p>One issue is that root domains (sometimes called “zone apex” or “naked domain”) have to be setup as an <strong>A record</strong>, not a CNAME. This means that with most DNS providers you can setup a subdomain CNAME (blog.jimgroom.me) to point to a service like GitHub, but you cannot setup your root domain (jimgroom.me) as a CNAME. That root domain would have to be an A record. Make sense? Good.</p>

<h3>Mapping your Domain on GitHub</h3>

<p>As you might have guessed from the above definitions, there are two methods for mapping a custom domain on GitHub: CNAME and A Records. You can get a good overview of <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-supported-custom-domains/">how Custom Domains work on GitHub here</a>. Mapping a subdomain using a <strong>CNAME record</strong> is recommended so the domain doesn’t break if the server IP changes, which may very well happen. That said, we understand sometimes you just need that root domain mapped, so an A Record is nice and will suffice.</p>

<h3>Mapping your Root Domain with A Records</h3>

<p>For this example I’ll be mapping the root domain jimgroom.me onto a Github page. In terms of getting your Github pages setup for this see GitHub’s “<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/">Setting Up a Custom Domain with GitHub Pages</a>.”</p>

<p>First you need to find the <strong>Advanced Zone Editor</strong> under the Domains section in cPanel.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/394f85722e50b562d901217f28843a2359939602.png" width="690" height="247"></p>

<p>After that you need to choose the root domain you will be mapping. In the example screenshot below you’ll see I have several, but you may only have one which would be the default.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/b27001077e7d68eb8004474dd0f3bb6fc60cf119.png" width="690" height="493"></p>

<p>Once you select the domain you need to create two A Records for it using the below screenshot as a template, through the Name will obviously be different depending on the root domain you are mapping. The two a Records will point to the following IP addresses on GitHub: <strong>192.30.252.153</strong> and <strong>192.30.252.154</strong>. You need to create a separate A Record for each of these IPs.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/e946e7d303aab9691449491f838139f3e038a403.png" width="690" height="474"></p>

<p>Once you have created both A Records in the Advanced DNS Zone Editor you should be all set. GitHub has their own documentation with “<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/">Tips for Configuring an A Record with Your DNS Provider</a>” that might also be useful. If you are having any issue see GitHub’s “<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/">My Custom Domain Isn’t Working</a>” or contact <strong>support@reclaimhosting.com</strong>.</p>

<h3>Mapping your Subdomain with CNAME Records</h3>

<p>For this example I’ll be mapping the subdomain blog.jimgroom.com onto a GitHub Pages Repository using a CNAME Record. Head to Advanced DNS Settings.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/3abab0dc508b4d02c55da9bc80080b24d17500ce.png" width="690" height="247"></p>

<p>Once there, select the domain you will be mapping to if you have more than one.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/462f5dc4e5f237e4d61d023f223741d38587c017.png" width="690" height="363"></p>

<p>Now you name to add a CNAME record with the subdomain you are mapping in the Name field and the URL of your GitHub account in the CNAME field.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/2c3e3347db73f61fb0a77a21bc6276d3d28e1025.png" width="690" height="423"></p>

<p>After that you should be set. I found even if your repository is jimgroom.github.io/blog like mine is in this instance, you only need jimgroom.githib.io in the CNAME field.</p>

<p>GitHub provides a page with “Tips for configuring a CNAME record with your DNS provider” if you need more help, comment below or put in a support ticket.</p>

I’m getting closer to full comprehension, but a little help never hurts so I took the following definition from <a href=\"https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/differences-a-cname-records/\">DNS Simple<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record/\">A record<\/a> points a name to a specific IP. For example, if you want blog.dnsimple.com to point to the server 185.31.17.133 you will configure:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote><p>blog.dnsimple.com. A 185.31.17.133<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/cname-record/\">CNAME record<\/a> points a name to another name, instead of an IP. The CNAME source represents an alias for the target name and inherits its entire resolution chain. Let’s take our blog as example:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote><p>blog.dnsimple.com. CNAME aetrion.github.io.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To summarize, an <strong>A record<\/strong> points a name to an IP. <strong>CNAME record<\/strong> can point a name to another CNAME...<\/p>\n\n<p>It’s good practice to point domains using <strong>CNAME records<\/strong> when possible because IP addresses can change, and when they do an A Record will break because it is hardcoded. You might think of CNAME records as relative hostnames, hence the IP address can change regularly but the mapped domain will not break.<\/p>\n\n<p>One issue is that root domains (sometimes called “zone apex” or “naked domain”) have to be setup as an <strong>A record<\/strong>, not a CNAME. This means that with most DNS providers you can setup a subdomain CNAME (blog.jimgroom.me) to point to a service like GitHub, but you cannot setup your root domain (jimgroom.me) as a CNAME. That root domain would have to be an A record. Make sense? Good.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Mapping your Domain on GitHub<\/h3>\n\n<p>As you might have guessed from the above definitions, there are two methods for mapping a custom domain on GitHub: CNAME and A Records. You can get a good overview of <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/about-supported-custom-domains/\">how Custom Domains work on GitHub here<\/a>. Mapping a subdomain using a <strong>CNAME record<\/strong> is recommended so the domain doesn’t break if the server IP changes, which may very well happen. That said, we understand sometimes you just need that root domain mapped, so an A Record is nice and will suffice.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Mapping your Root Domain with A Records<\/h3>\n\n<p>For this example I’ll be mapping the root domain jimgroom.me onto a Github page. In terms of getting your Github pages setup for this see GitHub’s “<a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/\">Setting Up a Custom Domain with GitHub Pages<\/a>.”<\/p>\n\n<p>First you need to find the <strong>Advanced Zone Editor<\/strong> under the Domains section in cPanel.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/1X/394f85722e50b562d901217f28843a2359939602.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"247\"><\/p>\n\n<p>After that you need to choose the root domain you will be mapping. In the example screenshot below you’ll see I have several, but you may only have one which would be the default.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/1X/b27001077e7d68eb8004474dd0f3bb6fc60cf119.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"493\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Once you select the domain you need to create two A Records for it using the below screenshot as a template, through the Name will obviously be different depending on the root domain you are mapping. The two a Records will point to the following IP addresses on GitHub: <strong>192.30.252.153<\/strong> and <strong>192.30.252.154<\/strong>. You need to create a separate A Record for each of these IPs.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/1X/e946e7d303aab9691449491f838139f3e038a403.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"474\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have created both A Records in the Advanced DNS Zone Editor you should be all set. GitHub has their own documentation with “<a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/\">Tips for Configuring an A Record with Your DNS Provider<\/a>” that might also be useful. If you are having any issue see GitHub’s “<a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/\">My Custom Domain Isn’t Working<\/a>” or contact <strong>support@reclaimhosting.com<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Mapping your Subdomain with CNAME Records<\/h3>\n\n<p>For this example I’ll be mapping the subdomain blog.jimgroom.com onto a GitHub Pages Repository using a CNAME Record. Head to Advanced DNS Settings.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/1X/3abab0dc508b4d02c55da9bc80080b24d17500ce.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"247\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Once there, select the domain you will be mapping to if you have more than one.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/1X/462f5dc4e5f237e4d61d023f223741d38587c017.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"363\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Now you name to add a CNAME record with the subdomain you are mapping in the Name field and the URL of your GitHub account in the CNAME field.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/1X/2c3e3347db73f61fb0a77a21bc6276d3d28e1025.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"423\"><\/p>\n\n<p>After that you should be set. I found even if your repository is jimgroom.github.io/blog like mine is in this instance, you only need jimgroom.githib.io in the CNAME field.<\/p>\n\n<p>GitHub provides a page with “Tips for configuring a CNAME record with your DNS provider” if you need more help, comment below or put in a support ticket.<\/p>","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2016-08-29T16:26:12.153Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"avg_time":27,"incoming_link_count":165,"reads":8,"score":792.95,"yours":false,"topic_id":270,"topic_slug":"domain-mapping-to-github","display_username":"Jim
