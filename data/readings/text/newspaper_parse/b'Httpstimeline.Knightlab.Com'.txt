Create your spreadsheet

Build a new Google Spreadsheet using our template. You'll need to copy the template to your own Google Drive account by clicking the "Make a Copy" button.

Drop dates, text and links to media into the appropriate columns. For more about working with our template, see our help docs.

Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
