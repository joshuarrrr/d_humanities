Code security

Prevent problems before they happen. Protected branches, signed commits, and required status checks protect your work and help you maintain a high standard for your code.

Access controlled

Encourage teams to work together while limiting access to those who need it with granular permissions and authentication through SAML/SSO and LDAP.

Hosted where you need it

Securely and reliably host your work on GitHub.com. Or, deploy GitHub Enterprise on your own servers or in a private cloud using Amazon Web Services, Azure or Google Cloud Platform.
