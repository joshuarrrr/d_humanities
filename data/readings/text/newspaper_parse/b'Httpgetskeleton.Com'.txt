Is Skeleton for you? You should use Skeleton if you're embarking on a smaller project or just don't feel like you need all the utility of larger frameworks. Skeleton only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and includes a grid, but that's often more than enough to get started. In fact, this site is built on Skeleton and has ~200 lines of custom CSS (half of which is the docking navigation). Love Skeleton and want to Tweet it, share it, or star it? Well, I appreciate that Tweet

The grid The grid is a 12-column fluid grid with a max width of 960px , that shrinks with the browser/device at smaller sizes. The max width can be changed with one line of CSS and all columns will resize accordingly. The syntax is simple and it makes coding responsive much easier. Go ahead, resize the browser.

Typography Type is all set with the rems , so font-sizes and spacial relationships can be responsively sized based on a single <html> font-size property. Out of the box, Skeleton never changes the <html> font-size, but it's there in case you need it for your project. All measurements are still base 10 though so, an <h1> with 5.0rem font-size just means 50px . The typography base is Raleway served by Google, set at 15rem (15px) over a 1.6 line height (24px). Other type basics like anchors, strong, emphasis, and underline are all obviously included. Headings create a family of distinct sizes each with specific letter-spacing , line-height , and margins . Heading <h1> 50rem Heading <h2> 42rem Heading <h3> 36rem Heading <h4> 30rem Heading <h5> 24rem Heading <h6> 15rem Heading Heading Heading Heading Heading Heading The base type is 15px over 1.6 line height (24px) Bolded Italicized Colored Underlined

Buttons Buttons come in two basic flavors in Skeleton. The standard <button> element is plain, whereas the .button-primary button is vibrant and prominent. Button styles are applied to a number of appropriate form elements, but can also be arbitrarily attached to anchors with a .button class.

Forms Forms are a huge pain, but hopefully these styles make it a bit easier. All inputs, select, and buttons are normalized for a common height cross-browser so inputs can be stacked or placed alongside each other.

Media queries Skeleton uses media queries to serve its scalable grid, but also has a list of queries for convenience of styling your site across devices. The queries are mobile-first, meaning they target min-width . Mobile-first queries are how Skeleton's grid is built and is the preferrable method of organizing CSS. It means all styles outside of a query apply to all devices, then larger devices are targeted for enhancement. This prevents small devices from having to parse tons of unused CSS. The sizes for the queries are: Desktop HD : 1200px

: 1200px Desktop : 1000px

: 1000px Tablet: 750px Phablet : 550px

: 550px Mobile: 400px /* Mobile first queries */ /* Larger than mobile */ @media (min-width: 400px) {} /* Larger than phablet */ @media (min-width: 550px) {} /* Larger than tablet */ @media (min-width: 750px) {} /* Larger than desktop */ @media (min-width: 1000px) {} /* Larger than Desktop HD */ @media (min-width: 1200px) {}

Utilities Skeleton has a number of small utility classes that act as easy-to-use helpers. Sometimes it's better to use a utility class than create a whole new class just to float an element. /* Utility Classes */ /* Make element full width */ .u-full-width { width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box; } /* Make sure elements don't run outside containers (great for images in columns) */ .u-max-full-width { max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box; } /* Float either direction */ .u-pull-right { float: right; } .u-pull-left { float: left; } /* Clear a float */ .u-cf { content: ""; display: table; clear: both; }
