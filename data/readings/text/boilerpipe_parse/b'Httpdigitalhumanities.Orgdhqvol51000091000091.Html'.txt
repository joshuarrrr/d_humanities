Abstract
As digital humanists have adopted visualization tools in their work, they have borrowed           methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social           sciences. These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and           certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we           need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the           concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and           characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical           expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the           use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between observer and           experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the           conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be           radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.
Introduction
1
As digital visualization tools have become more ubiquitous, humanists have adopted many           applications such as GIS mapping, graphs, and charts for statistical display that were           developed in other disciplines. But, I will argue, such graphical tools are a kind of           intellectual Trojan horse, a vehicle through which assumptions about what constitutes           information swarm with potent force. These assumptions are cloaked in a rhetoric taken           wholesale from the techniques of the empirical sciences that conceals their           epistemological biases under a guise of familiarity. So naturalized are the Google maps           and bar charts generated from spread sheets that they pass as unquestioned representations           of "what is". This is the hallmark of realist models of knowledge and needs to be           subjected to a radical critique to return the humanistic tenets of constructed-ness and           interpretation to the fore. Realist approaches depend above all upon an idea that           phenomena are observer-independent and can be characterized as data. Data pass themselves off as mere descriptions of a priori conditions.           Rendering observation (the act of creating a statistical, empirical, or subjective account           or image) as if it were the same as the phenomena observed collapses the           critical distance between the phenomenal world and its interpretation, undoing the basis           of interpretation on which humanistic knowledge production is based. We know this. But we           seem ready and eager to suspend critical judgment in a rush to visualization. At the very           least, humanists beginning to play at the intersection of statistics and graphics ought to           take a detour through the substantial discussions of the sociology of knowledge and its           developed critique of realist models of data gathering [1] At best, we need to take on the challenge of developing graphical expressions rooted in           and appropriate to interpretative activity.

Because realist approaches to visualization assume transparency and equivalence, as if           the phenomenal world were self-evident and the apprehension of it a mere mechanical task,           they are fundamentally at odds with approaches to humanities scholarship premised on           constructivist principles. I would argue that even for realist models, those that presume           an observer-independent reality available to description, the methods of presenting           ambiguity and uncertainty in more nuanced terms would be useful. Some significant progress           is being made in visualizing uncertainty in data models for GIS, decision-making,           archaeological research and other domains. [2] But an important           distinction needs to be clear from the outset: the task of representing ambiguity and           uncertainty has to be distinguished from a second task â that of using interpretations           that arise in observer-codependence, characterized by ambiguity and uncertainty, as the           basis on which a representation is constructed. This is the difference between putting           many kinds of points on a map to show degrees of certainty by shades of color, degrees of           crispness, transparency etc., and creating a map whose basic coordinate grid is           constructed as an effect of these ambiguities. In the first instance, we have           a standard map with a nuanced symbol set. In the second, we create a non-standard map that           expresses the constructed-ness of space. Both rely on rethinking our approach to           visualization and the assumptions that underpin it.
3
To overturn the assumptions that structure conventions acquired from other domains           requires that we re-examine the intellectual foundations of digital humanities, putting           techniques of graphical display on a foundation that is humanistic at its base. This             requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta. Differences in           the etymological roots of the terms data and capta make the distinction between           constructivist and realist approaches clear. Capta is "taken" actively while data is assumed to be a "given" able to be recorded and observed. From this           distinction, a world of differences arises. Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated,           partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that           knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given as a natural representation           of pre-existing fact.
4
My distinction between data and capta is not a covert suggestion that the humanities and           sciences are locked into intellectual opposition, or that only the humanists have the           insight that intellectual disciplines create the objects of their inquiry. Any           self-conscious historian of science or clinical researcher in the natural or social           sciences insists the same is true for their work. Statisticians are extremely savvy about           their artifices. Social scientists may divide between realist and constructivist           foundations for their research, but none are naÃ¯ve when it comes to the rhetorical           character of statistics. The history of knowledge is the history of forms of expression of           knowledge, and those forms change. What can be said, expressed, represented in any era is           distinct from that of any other, with all the attendant caveats and reservations that           attend to the study of the sequence of human intellectual events, keeping us from any           assertion of progress while noting the facts of change and transformation. The historical,           critical study of science is as full of discussions of this material as the           humanities.
5
Thus the representation of knowledge is as crucial to its cultural force as           any other facet of its production. The graphical forms of display that have come to the           fore in digital humanities in the last decade are borrowed from a mechanistic approach to           realism, and the common conception of data in those forms needs to be completely rethought           for humanistic work. To reiterate what I said above, the sheer power of the graphical           display of "information visualization" (and its novelty within a humanities community           newly enthralled with the toys of data mining and display) seems to have produced a           momentary blindness among practitioners who would never tolerate such literal assumptions           in textual work.
6
The polemic I set forth here outlines several basic principles on which to proceed           differently by suggesting that what is needed is not a set of applications to             display humanities "data" but a new approach that uses humanities principles to             constitute capta and its display. At stake, as I have said before and in many           contexts, is the authority of humanistic knowledge in a culture increasingly beset by           quantitative approaches that operate on claims of certainty. Bureaucracies           process human activity through statistical means and when the methods grounded in           empirical sciences are put at the service of the social sciences or humanities in a           crudely reductive manner, basic principles of critical thought are violated, or at the           very least, put too far to the side. To intervene in this ideological system, humanists,           and the values they embrace and enact, must counter with conceptual tools that demonstrate           humanities principles in their operation, execution, and display. The digital humanities           can no longer afford to take its tools and methods from disciplines whose fundamental           epistemological assumptions are at odds with humanistic method.
7
This paper is a call to imaginative action and intellectual engagement with the challenge           of rethinking digital tools for visualization on basic principles of the humanities. I           take these principles to be, first, that the humanities are committed to the concept of           knowledge as interpretation, and, second, that the apprehension of the phenomena of the           physical, social, cultural world is through constructed and constitutive acts, not           mechanistic or naturalistic realist representations of pre-existing or self-evident           information. Nothing in intellectual life is self-evident or self-identical, nothing in           cultural life is mere fact, and nothing in the phenomenal world gives rise to a record or           representation except through constructed expressions. The rhetorical force of graphical           display is too important a field for its design to be adopted without critical scrutiny           and the full force of theoretical insight. Let me suggest what that means for the           visualization of informational, temporal, and spatial phenomena.
Data as capta: from information visualization to graphical expressions of           interpretation
8
If I set up a bar chart or graph, my first act is to draw a set of one or more axes and           divide them into units. The conventional forms of the graphical display of information,           "data", make use of a formal, unambiguous system of standard metrics. Charts use simple           (if often misleading) geometric forms that lend themselves to legible comparison of           values, proportions, or the exhibition of state changes across time. Lines, bars, columns,           and pie charts are the common and familiar forms. They render quantitative relations with a transparency that seems natural, so that, for instance, if we look at the           changes in population across a series of years for a particular location, we can simply           accept that from one year to the next rises or drops occurred in the numbers of persons           alive in X city in X country at X time. A pie chart showing percentage of resource           allocation from national budgets seems completely transparent, self-evident even. A bar           chart could compare daylight hours at different longitudes, or the average size of men and           women in different countries, or the number of hospital beds in different institutions in           a single geographical location and not raise a skeptical eyebrow, right? Yes, but the           rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and           legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework on which the           statistical data were constructed. The graphical force conceals what the statistician           knows very well â that no "data" pre-exist their parameterization. Data             are capta, taken not given, constructed as an interpretation of the phenomenal           world, not inherent in it.
9
To expose the constructedness of data as capta a number of systematic changes have to be           applied to the creation of graphical displays. That is the foundation and purpose of a humanistic approach to the qualitative display of graphical information.           Read that last formulation carefully, humanistic approach means that the           premises are rooted in the recognition of the interpretative nature of           knowledge, that the display itself is conceived to embody qualitative             expressions, and that the information is understood as graphically             constituted. Each of these factors contains an explicit critique of assumptions           in the conventional "visual display of quantitative information" that is the common           currency.
10
Let me work through a specific case to show how each of these principles â           humanistic approach, qualitative display, and graphical information â can be           demonstrated. As an example, we can use that bar chart mentioned above, one that compares           the percentage of men and women in various national populations at the present time.
FigureÂ 1.Â 
A basic bar chart compares the number of men (top bar) and the             number of women (bottom bar) in seven different nations, A through F, at the present             time (2010). The assumptions are that quantities (number), entities (nations),             identities (gender) and temporality (now) are all self-evident. Graphic credit XÃ¡rene Eskandar.
11
Certain issues immediately arise. A standard critique of data introduces reservations           about the appearance of certainty such a chart presents. What counts as a nation? Are           transient and immigrant populations documented? What kind of time span counts as "at the             present time" within which these populations are counted? If the basic bar chart would           have looked like a series of bands showing discrete categories of information in finite           and certain numbers (all due statistical caveats noted), what are the problems? Gender           definition assumes a simple binary distinction of men and women, an assumption much           debated and highly problematic (gender can be understood as a factor of behavior,           physiological changes, social expectations, dress, etc., and nation as a function of           permeability of borders, citizenship patterns, naturalization rules, immigration           regulations, quotas and border policies). So the bar chart reifies several categories,           naturalizing them as discrete and fixed: national populations, time span, and gender           defined as a simple binary. The representation can only be modified by changing the terms           and premises on which it is constructed. What would a representation of gender by sliding           scale look like? How would permeable boundaries to nations whose populations cross each           others borders be shown? How would they dissolve the bar chartâs basic structure? How           would notions of the present be defined?
FigureÂ 2.Â 
In this chart gendered identity is modified. In nation A, the               top bar contains a changing gradient, indicating that "man" is a continuum from male               enfant to adult, or in countries E and D, that gender ambiguity is a factor of genetic               mutation or adaptation, thus showing that basis on which gendered individuals are               identified and counted is complicated by many factors. In country F women only               register as individuals after coming of reproductive age, thus showing that quantity               is a effect of cultural conditions, not a self-evident fact. The movement of men back               and forth across the border of nations B and C makes the "nations" unstable               entities. Graphic credit XÃ¡rene Eskandar.
12
The point Iâm making is that the basic categories of supposedly quantitative information,           the fundamental parameters of chart production, are already interpreted expressions. But           they do not present themselves as categories of interpretation, riven with ambiguity and           uncertainty, because of the representational force of the visualization as a           "picture" of "data". For instance, the assumption that gender is a binary category, stable           across all cultural and national communities, is an assertion, an argument. Gendered           identity defined in binary terms is not a self-evident fact, no matter how often Olympic           committees come up against the need for a single rigid genital criterion on which to           determine difference. By recognizing the always interpreted character of data we have           shifted from data to capta, acknowledging the constructed-ness of the categories according           to the uses and expectations for which they are put in service. Nations, genders,           populations, and time spans are not self-evident, stable entities that exist a priori.           They are each subject to qualifications and reservations that bear directly on and arise           from the reality of lived experience. The presentation of the comparison in the original           formulation grotesquely distorts the complexity â but also, the basic ambiguity           â of the phenomenon under investigation (gender, nations, populations). If the           challenge we are facing were merely to accommodate higher levels of complexity into a data           representation model, that would require one set of considerations and modifications. But           the more profound challenge we face is to accept the ambiguity of knowledge, the           fundamentally interpreted condition on which data is constructed, in other words, the           realization of my refrainâthat all data is capta.
13
The humanistic aspect of this approach should be obvious â that knowledge           created with the acknowledgement of the fundamentally constructed nature of its premises is not commensurate with principles of certainty guiding empirical or realist methods.           Humanistic methods are counter to the idea of reliably repeatable experiments or standard           metrics that assume observer independent phenomena. By definition, a humanistic approach           is centered in the experiential, subjective conditions of interpretation. Phenomena and           their observers are co-dependent, not necessarily in equal measure. A viewer gazing on a           sublime landscape or recording migrations at a large scale may be more affected by the           phenomena than the phenomena is by the observation. Theoretical physicist Werner           Heisenberg never suggested that the relation of intervening observer and effect on           phenomena were symmetrical, merely that they were codependent, when he introduced the           concept of uncertainty in the early 20th century.
14
Creating bar charts with ambiguity and degrees of uncertainty or other variables in them           might cause champions of legibility and transparency some unease, but the shift away from           standard metrics to metrics that express interpretation is an essential move for humanists           and/or constructivists across disciplines. To emphasize the expressive quality of           interpretation, Iâm going to characterize constructed information as subjective â expressing the marks of its inflection in some formal way. The           shift to expressive metrics and graphics is essential in changing from the expression of subjective information to the subjective expression of             perceived phenomena, but subjectivity and inflection are not the only features of           interpretative approaches. Capta is not an expression of idiosyncracy, emotion, or           individual quirks, but a systematic expression of information understood as constructed,           as phenomena perceived according to principles of interpretation. To do this, we need to           conceive of every metric "as a factor of X", where X is a point of view, agenda,           assumption, presumption, or simply a convention. By qualifying any metric as a factor of           some condition, the character of the "information" shifts from self-evident           "fact" to           constructed interpretation motivated by a human agenda. [3]
15
The standard elements of graphic display for statistical information are simple and           limited: scale divisions, coordinate lines, scale figures, circles, rectangles, curves,           bars (or columns or percentages of pie charts or other forms) and labels (numbers and           terms), signs of movement, flow, or state change (arrows, vectors, paths). The ordering           and arrangement of elements within a chart create another level of information, relational           information. Relational information is graphically produced â the ordering of elements by           size, by color, by alphabetical order, by texture, shape or other feature happens in           graphical space. The resulting arrangement has a semantic value produced by features of           proximity, grouping, orientation, apparent movement, and other graphical effects.
18
In statistical graphics the coordinate lines are always continuous and straight. In           humanistic, interpretative, graphics, they might have breaks, repetitions, and curves or           dips. Interpretation is stochastic and probabilistic, not mechanistic, and its           uncertainties require the same mathematical and computational models as other complex           systems.
20
Perhaps the most striking feature distinguishing humanistic, interpretative, and           constructivist graphical expressions from realist statistical graphics is that the curves,           bars, columns, percentage values would not always be represented as discrete bounded           entities, but as conditional expressions of interpretative parametersâa kind of visual           fuzzy logic or graphical complexity. Thus their edges might be permeable, lines dotted and           broken, dots and points vary in size and scale or degree of ambiguity of placement, and so           on. These graphical strategies express interpreted knowledge, situated and partial, rather           than complete. They can be employed as systematically as other charting elements, though           part of my intention is to disturb the grounds of certainty on which conventions of           statistical legibility are based. Point of view systems introduced into graphs and charts           will make evident a perspectival position with respect to their information, an inner           standing point in the graphical rendering of space. This is true of all cartographic           projections. Every map contains within its coordinate system for graphical expression, a           set of assumptions about the place from which the map is drawn. Information spaces drawn           from a point of view, rather than as if they were observer independent, reinsert the           subjective standpoint of their creation into the graphical expression. Finally, any point           or mark used as a specific node in a humanistic graph is assumed to have many dimensions           to it â each of which complicates its identity by suggesting the embedded-ness of its           existence in a system of co-dependent relations. Information entities, or units, are thus           understood as fictional abstractions serving a purpose. But their potential to be read           again in relation to any number of other equally significant relations can be made           evident. This approach destroys the ground on which standard metrics are used to abstract           quantitative information from human circumstances. Humanistic premises replace notions of           statistical concepts of self-identity with entangled co-dependence and contingencies.
21
All of this may sound unduly complicated to someone merely wanting to count the number of           pupils enrolled in a group, calculate the number of pencils needed, or to show budgetary           expenditures on a per capita basis in the classroom, for example. But this example           â an instance of administrative and bureaucratic management â shows           that such crudely conceived numeric statistics are useful only in the most reductive           circumstances. They tell us nothing about whether the pencils can be used, whether the           pupils are prepared or disposed to their work, or whether the budgets will have any effect           on learning outcomes or any of the many other factors that come into play in assessments           based on metrics extracted from lived experience. But each metric â number of X           or Y â is actually a number as a factor of a particular intellectual assumption           or decision: pupils as a factor of seats in a room, birthdates, population, illness, etc.           pencils as a factor of resource allocation, and so on. All metrics are metrics about           something for some purpose.
22
Any humanistic study based on statistical methods, even the simplest techniques of           counting, has to address the assumption involved in the categories on which such           techniques ("how many of X") are based. Take another example from work in data mining or           "distant reading" as it is known in the digital humanities: counting the number of novels           published in a given year. This involves an enormous number of interpretative decisions â           each of which has more intellectual dimensions than any numeric assessment could.
FigureÂ 3.Â 
A chart shows the number of new novels put into print by a single             publisher in the years 1855-1862.
FigureÂ 4.Â 
The "appearance" in 1855 of fourteen novels is shown in relation             to the time of writing, acquisition, editing, pre-press work, and release thus showing             publication date as a factor of many other processes whose temporal range is very             varied. The date of a work, in terms of its cultural identity and relevance, can be             considered in relation to any number of variables, not just the moment of its             publication.

23
For instance, what is a novel, what does "published" mean in this context (date of           appearance, editing, composition, acquisition, review, distribution), and how was the           "year" determined. Statistical methods come into play after these decisions           have been made, counting objects whose identity was established by interpretative             decisions. Many aspects of constructed-ness are in play. But the graphical           presentation of supposedly self-evident information (again, formulated in this example as           "the number of novels published in a year") conceals these complexities, and the           interpretative factors that bring the numerics into being, under a guise of graphical           legibility. I cannot overstate the perniciousness of such techniques for the effect of           passing construction off as real, and violating the very premises of humanistic           inquiry.
24
The challenge is to design graphical expressions suited to the display of interpreted           phenomena: information about subjective user-dependent metrics, subjective displays of information, and subjective methods of           graphical expression. The term subjective is used as shorthand for interpretative           construction, for the registration of point of view, position, the place from which and           agenda according to which parameterization occurs. Subjectivity is not the same as           individual inflection or mere idiosyncracy, but is meant to put codependent relations of           observer and phenomena (in contrast to presumptions of objectivity, or           observer-independent phenomena).
25
The display of information about inflection of affective experience can easily use           standard metrics. For example, a chart that shows mood changes or degrees of attraction or           any other information related to subjectivity can be created with standard metrics and           visual conventions.

The next task is more complicated. Subjective information, that is information whose           constitution exhibits its subjective character, deviates from the standard norms by using           graphic variables such as intensity of tone, size, color, or other feature to embody its           qualities. Subjective information can use graphical means to show its inflected character,           demonstrating its deviation from standard norms in the way the display looks, or, in           dynamic displays, the way it acts. One might imagine skittish points on an           unstable grid to display the degrees of anxiety around a particular event or task, for instance, or points that glow hot or cold depending on the other elements that approach           them. That would be a subjective â even affective â display of             information.
Creating a display whose structure arises from subjective methods of           graphical expression extends this last example to the design of the basic visual           structure.

A chart in which the subjective information shapes the metric. The activities             are given tonal values, size, and weight in order to create a mass or volume that then             determines the dimensions of the "day" which they constitute. The box "day" does not             have an a priori dimension that is used to contain the elements, it is created as an             effect of the elements. This is a distinctly different approach to metrics. The chart is             generated to express the co-dependent relation of viewer and experience rather than to             display user experience as if it were independent of observation. The temporal             dimensional of each day depends upon the relations among events, moods, and activities,             but not predictably. The shape of the days is made by the creation of the list. Graphic credit XÃ¡rene Eskandar.

A subjective grid to show anxiety might have a widely varying set of spacings to show           that the information on display is constituted as a variable of some other aspect of           experience (number of family members present at an event, for instance). Recognizing that           such subjective methods are anathema to the empirically minded makes me even more           convinced that they are essential for the generation of graphical displays of           interpretative and interpreted information.
29
The basic principle underlying such graphical displays is that capta marks its           interpreted status. Interpreted knowledge is situated, observer co-dependent, and partial.           Its variables are, in theory, infinite, but they are always present in some degree or           measure by virtue of the performative and participatory character of interpretative           information. Interpretation depends upon and is an expression of an individual reading in           a particular set of circumstances and never presumes to completeness or observer           independence. The requirements for legibility increase with these unfamiliar graphics, and           they will need labeling to make explicit the justifications for their non-normative           seeming appearance. Iâm not advocating idiosyncracy, or intellectual solipsism, but a           systematic approach to graphics that is appropriate to its principles.
30
These humanistic principles can be readily applied to the graphical display of temporal           and spatial information. So I will turn my attention in these next two sections to some of           the principles on which temporality and spatiality can also be given graphical expression           through humanistic approaches.
Time as Temporality
31
Since antiquity, human conceptions of time have divided between those that consider time           a given, an a priori existing container within which events occur, and those who consider           time an effect of occurrences in temporal relation to each other. I take the latter view.           The relational structure of temporality is always constituted according to inflections and           variables. Not all days are equal. Or all minutes. Or all hours. Time understood as           temporality can be succinctly stated as follows: Temporality = time as a factor of             X where X is any variable (fear, speed, anxiety, foreshadowing,           regret, reconsideration, narration, etc.).
32
Humanists deal with the representation of temporality of documents (when           they were created), in documents (narrated, represented, depicted           temporality), the construction of temporality across documents (the           temporality of historical events), and also the shape of temporality that emerges from documentary evidence (the shape of an era, a season, a period or           epoch). They need a way to graph and chart temporality in an approach that suits the basic           principles of interpretative knowledge.
33
Conceptions of temporality in humanities documents do not conform to those used in the           social and empirical sciences. In empirical sciences, time is understood as continuous,           uni-directional, and homogenous. Its metrics are standardized, its direction is           irreversible, and it has no breaks, folds, holes, wrinkles, or reworkings. But in the           humanities time is frequently understood and represented as discontinuous,           multi-directional, and variable. Temporal dimensions of humanities artifacts are often           expressed in relational terms â before such and such happened, or after a significant           event. Retrospection and anticipation factor heavily in humanistic works, and the models           of temporality that arise from historical and literary documents include multiple           viewpoints.
34
The temporal modeling project Bethany Nowviskie and I designed almost ten years ago made           use of these basic insights in order to create a graphical application that was the           working proof of a concept. We were intent on demonstrating that a graphical model could           be created intuitively as an interpretation and then used to generate structured data as a           result. Inverting the sequence of intellectual events was a radical move for digital           humanities, especially at the time, suggesting that graphical knowledge could be primary,           leading an interpretation, rather than always and only functioning to display what was           already known (or assumed to be known). We wanted to demonstrate that visual spaces could           be a primary site of intellectual work. Of course, that added yet another level of           unfamiliarity to our already complex project â and many even in our immediate community           were unsettled by elastic or stretchy timelines, multiple points of view from within the           system, or other novel seeming conventions meant to serve for interpretation of literary           and historical artifacts.
35
Briefly summarized, the original Temporal Modelling project aimed at creating a set of           conceptual primitives for the modeling of temporal relations. These included graphical           expressions meant to meet the needs of multiple points of view, reworking events according           to a changed position within a temporal sequence, and a set of what we called inflections.           Inflections, a kind of legend for marking points, intervals, or events (our basic units)           with a quality or attribute, were divided into semantic and syntactic types. Semantic           inflections were given their characteristics independently, as entities, and the           vocabulary of attributes included degrees of intensity and other qualities. Syntactic           inflections were characterized as relational, marking the effect of one event, point, or           interval or another.
Methods for graphing the elastic or "rubber-sheet" timelines meant to show the subjective           variations in temporality can be derived from catastrophe theory, chaos diagrams, and the           visualizations of stochastic and complex systems.
FigureÂ 7.Â 
Models of events as temporal folds along a line of crisis. The               first is a simple fold, showing an event as a combination of stresses warping a plane.               An upper branch of consequences peels off towards an abrupt termination while the               lower branch curve back to allow a retrospective view of the eventâs unfolding back               onto an earlier moment.

These visualizations express the topological and systemic complexity necessary           to model the number of variables (of coordinates, forces, and the changing relations of           variables) present in the experience of events, and/or analysis of their representation in           humanistic documents (e.g. novels, films, letters, etc.). Some of the features of our           earlier design, such as the dynamic behaviors of syntactic relations, could not be           expressed in a standard Cartesian coordinate system (such as the one on which XML output           is generated), even though dynamic and performative syntactic relations can be made           operational by using vectors or forces.
FigureÂ 8.Â

But even standard coordinate systems, such as the conventions of perspectival           drawing, allow for the interpretative quality temporal experience to be expressed more           fully than is possible with standard timelines. A parallax view, in which prospective           anticipation is gradually replaced with retrospective reassessment, can be generated with           a slider that animates the dynamic transformation in the value, identity, and relation of           temporal events. In such a view, temporal events expressed as a set of conditions, rather           than givens. The slider indicates a point of view, a perspective from which the experience           of temporality originates in an individual.
FigureÂ 9.Â 
A linear model of parallax showing anticipation and               retrospective assessment of an event. The "event" is the combination of the moods of               the "eye" individual, indicated by the anticipatory arrow and then the retrospective               view (lower arrow) across the bar and star that mark a moment and a duration in the               temporal span. The event is warped in the retrospective view. The metric might be               altered as an effect, though it is not in this depiction. The "eye" is a now-slider,               as per the old temporal modeling design, and its position on the bottom line indicates               the position of the observer within the course of even.

By breaking the relentlessly regular grid, the potential for graphing temporal           modeling as a complex system of events is greatly enhanced. The relational, and           co-dependent quality of temporal events finds its expression in these more sophisticated           models
37
Several fundamental principles can now guide these designs. These principles of           non-continuous, non-homogenous, and multi-directional temporality, as well as           the point of view parallax, refine the reductive crudeness of models linked to standard a           priori metrics of uni-directional, continuous, homogenous time. In this           refinement temporality is conceived according to the basic formulation mentioned above:           time as a function of x (temporality= time (x)). In these formulations, x is any of the           (theoretically infinite) variables that inflect the model (mood, events, influences,           events, constraints, etc.). Because temporality is an act of form-making (constructivist),           not an act of expressing pre-existing or a priori phenomena (realism), the sequence of           intellectual events in this formulation insists on temporality (and, likewise, spatiality           as the result of constitutive relations among temporal and spatial phenomena. The full           realization of this approach requires a multi-dimensional, complex, model of space and           time and imaginative realizations as graphical expression.

In the first image, anxiety (measured subjectively but charted on             a standard metric) is charted against time, also depicted with standard intervals. The             change from one state to another (changes in degrees of anxiety) is shown in a             continuous line. Graphic credit XÃ¡rene Eskandar.

The difference between one state and the next is used to generate             a graphical form that is expresses the changes from one moment to another. Graphic credit XÃ¡rene Eskandar.
FigureÂ 13.Â 
The differences between states are projected onto the             anxiety and time axes to create a metric that is the effect of perception, rather than             an a priri given. By rotating the angles that marked changes of levels of anxiety into a             position parallel to the time line, the metrics can be changed as a projection of these             lines (whose lengths were generated by a combination of duration and change of intensity             of anxiety) onto the temporal axis, thus moving from a "perceived" time to a "projected"             time. The result is a set of transformations from an uninflected, supposedly observer             independent "time" and "anxiety" to one created as an effect of the experience of time             on its expression.

Space as Spatiality
38
The discussion of space corresponds exactly to that of time, and the distinctions between           the conception of space as an a priori given and that of space as relationally constituted           marks the same philosophical division of approaches as those that are used in charting or           understanding time and temporality. Likewise, spatiality is to be understood as space as a           function of x (spatiality= space (x)). [4]
39
To give graphical expression to these ideas requires using non-standard metrics,           intuitive and subjective principles of design. They are meant as provocations to the           larger project of creating more systematic renderings of humanistic phenomena, introducing           basic transformations of the graphical fields we created for time lines into mapping and           GIS applications. Precedents for such renderings can be foundâe.g. Francis Galtonâs           rendering of space as a function of travel time. Galtonâs problem, formulated in the mid           19th century, takes into account that most statistical phenomena are observer-dependent           and situated, and canât be separated from the various dependencies that bear upon the           creation of data. Galton, in other words, recognized that in many circumstances, data were           capta. The statistical description of phenomena depend upon the observerâs circumstances.           A more recent demonstration of these principles is a map designed by Tom Carden. His           dynamic interface redraws the London Underground map as function of time of travel from           any selected station to any other station. [5]
40
Subjective parameters are even more difficult to inscribe, since they cannot, by           definition, be based on simple consensual standards. We can easily understand these           distortionsâ space as a result of travel time. But how could we visualize the spatial           distortions introduced by variables such as fearfulness, anxiety, anticipation,           distraction, or dalliance and thus render space as spatiality, space as a factor of             x? Some variable is always in play in the experience of space as well as its           representation, so space is also always constructed according to a specific agenda and a           situated experience etc. While this is the common experience of the phenomenal world,           representations of spatiality have lagged behind, dominated by the navigational or           descriptive systems of standard mapping whose conventions are well known and recognized,           and which partake of and impose the dominant realist model.
