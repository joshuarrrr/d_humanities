Includes
The include tag allows you to include the content from another file stored in the _includes folder:
{% include footer.html %}
Jekyll will look for the referenced file (in this case, footer.html) in the _includes directory at the root of your source directory and insert its contents.
Including files relative to another file
You can choose to include file fragments relative to the current file by using the include_relative tag:
{% include_relative somedir/footer.html %}
You won’t need to place your included content within the _includes directory. Instead, the inclusion is specifically relative to the file where the tag is being used. For example, if _posts/2014-09-03-my-file.markdown uses the include_relative tag, the included file must be within the _posts directory or one of its subdirectories.
Note that you cannot use the ../ syntax to specify an include location that refers to a higher-level directory.
All the other capabilities of the include tag are available to the include_relative tag, such as variables.
Using variables names for the include file
The name of the file you want to embed can be specified as a variable instead of an actual file name. For example, suppose you defined a variable in your page’s front matter like this:
--- title: My page my_variable: footer_company_a.html ---
You could then reference that variable in your include:
{% include {{ page.my_variable }} %}
In this example, the include would insert the file footer_company_a.html from the _includes/footer_company_a.html directory.
Passing parameters to includes
You can also pass parameters to an include. For example, suppose you have a file called note.html in your _includes folder that contains this formatting:
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> {{ include.content }} </div>
The {{ include.content }} is a parameter that gets populated when you call the include and specify a value for that parameter, like this:
{% include note.html content="This is my sample note." %}
The value of content (which is This is my sample note) will be inserted into the {{ include.content }} parameter.
Passing parameters to includes is especially helpful when you want to hide away complex formatting from your Markdown content.
For example, suppose you have a special image syntax with complex formatting, and you don’t want your authors to remember the complex formatting. As a result, you decide to simplify the formatting by using an include with parameters. Here’s an example of the special image syntax you might want to populate with an include:
<figure> <a href="http://jekyllrb.com"> <img src="logo.png" style="max-width: 200px;" alt="Jekyll logo" /> <figcaption>This is the Jekyll logo</figcaption> </figure>
You could templatize this content in your include and make each value available as a parameter, like this:
<figure> <a href="{{ include.url }}"> <img src="{{ include.file }}" style="max-width: {{ include.max-width }};"       alt="{{ include.alt }}"/> <figcaption>{{ include.caption }}</figcaption> </figure>
This include contains 5 parameters:
url
