Welcome!
OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data:  cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with  web services and external data.
Please note that since October 2nd, 2012, Google is not actively supporting  this project, which has now been rebranded to OpenRefine.
