Why aren't my Google Drive or DropBox Zoomify images working?
Unfortunately, Google has deprecated web hosting in Google Drive , which means that Zoomify images hosted on Google Drive. will no longer display. Dropbox has similary discontinued rendering content in public folders , so this method will cause problems for many users as well.
We're working on a solution, but for right now the only other option seems to be hosting your images on a web server.
Why are my DropBox images not showing
First the image must be in the public folder.
To get the image URL change the domain name from the link that dropbox creates.

How can I have a map without the lines between points?
To disable connecting lines on maps, use the StoryMap option: Treat as Image (as opposed to the default, Treat as Cartography)
How can I link to a specific slide?
You can add a parameter to the URL that is the value of the iframe src attribute, start_at_slide. Its value should be a number from 0 to one less than the total number of slides in the storymap.
For example: http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/storymapjs/latest/embed/?url=//media.knightlab.com/StoryMapJS/demo/sochi.json&start_at_slide=5
This should load
Sochi 2014 Olympic Torch Relay Highlights: Slide 5.
How can I use a custom map?
Choose options from the top left of the StoryMap window, then from the map type menu choose the type you like.
Select Mapbox to enter the ID of your Mapbox map.
Select custom to enter the URL for a tile server. If the server supports multiple subdomains, enter them as a single string in the Subdomain field (e.g. subdomains 'a', 'b', and 'c' should be entered as 'abc').
How can I adjust the zoom?
To keep it simple for most users, we've made some assumptions in the authoring tool which may not universally apply. For example, the first screen is always an overview slide. Also, the zoom is affected by the overall size of the map and the relationship between the current and previous points on the map.
It's possible to download the configuration (a JSON file) that the authoring tool makes and edit the JSON yourself. You could then change the first slide to not be an overview and manually set a starting lat/lon/zoom.
Be aware that switching back and forth between editing within and outside the authoring tool can get messy, so we suggest using our advanced method to have maximum control over the zoom feature and more.
