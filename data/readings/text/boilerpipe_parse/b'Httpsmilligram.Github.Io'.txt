Tips
Tips, techniques, and best practice on using Cascading Style Sheets.
Mobile First
The Mobile First is the design strategy that takes priority development for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. It means all styles outside of a media queries apply to all devices, then larger screens are targeted for enhancement. This prevents small devices from having to parse tons of unused CSS. Milligram use some breakpoints like these:
Larger than Mobile screen: 40.0rem (640px)
Larger than Tablet screen: 80.0rem (1280px)
Larger than Desktop screen: 120.0rem (1920px)
/* Mobile First Media Queries */  /* Base style */ { ... }  /* Larger than mobile screen */ @media (min-width: 40.0rem) { ... }  /* Larger than tablet screen */ @media (min-width: 80.0rem) { ... }  /* Larger than desktop screen */ @media (min-width: 120.0rem) { ... }
Embed Font
Milligram uses the font-family Roboto , created by Christian Robertson, and provided by Google. Customize your projects using Google Fonts . To embed your selected fonts into a webpage, copy this code into the of your HTML document.
/* Embed Font */
/* Use the following CSS rules to specify these families */ body {   font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif; }
Extending The Inheritances
The style of an element can be defined in several different locations, which interact in a complex way. It is this form of interaction makes CSS powerful, but it can make it confusing and difficult to debug.
