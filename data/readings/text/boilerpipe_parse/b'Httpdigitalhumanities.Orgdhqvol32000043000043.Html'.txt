This suggests that male language in Black Drama is somewhat more marked than female     language, both at the level of authors and at the level of language represented by how authors     write characters.
27
Machine learning systems are clearly able to identify gender of playwrights and their     characters with impressive accuracy. We have found that on raw running texts, the systems can     reliably identify author gender at rates between the high 60s and mid-70s percent accuracy. And,     as the plays are processed in various ways to eliminate potential skewing factors â such as     unbalanced subsets, extraneous textual data (e.g. stage directions), and differences in raw word     counts â classification performance increases. This increase in performance comes, however, at     the cost of increasing the distance from the text themselves.
28
Given the ability to classify author and character genders, we will now return to the texts     briefly to examine the features most characteristic of gendered writing in Black Drama. Appendix     Two shows the top 200 features as measure by Bayesian probability ratios, broken down by male     and female playwrights without respect to character gender. The features suggest a rather     traditional set of gender distinctions. Male authors tend to focus on legal/criminal issues     (officer, gang, pistol, jail, etc.); numerous obscenities and slurs (bullshit, nigger(s),     goddamn, fuck, shit); music (band, drum, leader, drums, spiritual, player, jazz); and money     (dollars, price, cents, cash, etc.). Female playwrights of this period tend to privilege issues     concerning family/home (child, stories, hug, mama, girls, birth); emotive states (smiling,     imagine, memories, memory, happiness, happy); descriptions (handsome, lovely, grace, cute,     courage, loving, ugly); and women (herself, girls, she, female, lady, women, her). The     representation of traditional gender roles are most notable in the characterization of     non-American male authors. As shown in Appendix Three , male characters are given very clear     public roles, with the top eight words by probability ratios being "chief, order,      government, lead, power, position, country, land" while the female characters are     limited to the private realm ("husband, dress, shame, marry, doctor, married, please,      parents").
29
Gender characterization among American authors writing between 1950-2006 (Appendices 4 and 5)     provides evidence that men and women depict characters slightly differently. The feature sets     are rather similar: both contain numbers (men generally do counting) and share terms as varied     as sir, american, power, bitch, country, and killed. But the male list is noticeably coarser,     with more profanity, the term "nigger(s)," and more references to law enforcement     and violence. With only a few exceptions, the female character feature lists have basically the     same domestic tenor. In contrast to male characters, female characters apparently use very     little profanity and seem to be much less involved in struggles with public authorities. Of     course, these lists only reveal generalities. The features are differential frequencies. There     might in fact be foul-mouthed female characters in the corpus who are active in the public     sphere. But those characters would probably be exceptions. The degree to which these lists     reveal true differences among black American male and female authors is a matter for discussion.     The important thing is that the mining algorithm gives fuel to the discussion and serves as a     starting point for closer textual study.
30
This same character gender classification test on non-American authors yields feature sets     suggesting even more disparate depictions of the sexes than among American authors. Appendices 6 and 7 show that, for authors of both sexes, male characters inhabit the public sphere, their     discourse deals with leadership, and they are more likely to use grammatically precise terms     like "which" and "whom." Female characters' language, again,     primarily centers on domestic concerns. Distinctions between male and female authors' use of     language in the depiction of their characters are few. One of the striking differences, however,     is that only the male characters written by female authors in this data set use scatalogical     language at a significant rate. And comparing the results from the American and non-American     tests highlights the different concerns for these characters who inhabit different cultures.
31
Classification of texts by gender of playwrights, characters, and the combination of the two     is a more difficult test than by nationality. Results ranging from high-60 percent accuracy for     plays as they are found to the mid-80s in carefully constructed samples extracted from the     texts. It is also clear that the features used to construct classifier models might be of     interest to literary researchers in that they identify themes and language use that characterize     gender distinctions. Of course, men talk more of wives than women and only women tend to call     other women "hussies," so it is hardly surprising that male and female     authors/characters speak of different things in somewhat different ways. The features suggest,     however, that we are finding "lowest common denominators" which distinguish male     from female, but which may also privilege particular stereotypes. The unhappy relationship of     Black American men with the criminal justice system or the importance of family matters to women     are both certainly themes raised in these plays. The experimental design itself, using     classifiers to detect patterns of word usage which most distinguish the genders, may bring to     the forefront literary and linguistic elements which play a relatively minor role in the texts     themselves.
Conclusion
32
We have found that, although algorithms can in fact detect differences in lexical usage to a     striking degree and output feature sets that characterize differences between corpora of data,     human scholars must still do the work of scrutinizing results and, more importantly, decide how     best to develop these tools for humanities research. Fundamentally, automatic classifiers deal     with general features and common traits. In contrast, in recent decades, literary criticism has     focused on the peripheries, often looking at the ways understudied works by authors from     underrepresented groups work within a larger cultural context. Literary critics have tried to     nuance general understanding about what the mainstream is and how it works. As we mentioned     above, a danger in framing comparative tasks based on binary oppositions is that doing so can     produce simplistic or stereotypical results. Furthermore, given the power of classifiers, we     might always be able to prove or detect some binary opposition between two groups of texts. And     so the task before us, if we want to develop tools to aid literary criticism, is to try in some     way to respond to the values driving scholarship currently and, as those values change, continue     to take them into account. We must also keep in mind that measures of success and procedure are     often different for computer scientists and literary critics. For example, using only 60 total     feature terms, 30 per corpus, we can classify the Black Drama texts as American or non-American     with approximately 90% accuracy. Distinguishing differences on such a small number of words is     an impressive technical feat, to be sure. But to a literary scholar, such a circumscribed way of     thinking about creative work may not be terribly fruitful. As we go forward, we will have to try     to bridge gaps such as these. Our success in this endeavor will, of course, depend upon close     collaboration between those building the data mining tools and those who will finally use     them.

[1]The experimental protocol which we have been developing for this purpose, as applied by,      e.g. [ Argamon et al. 2003 ], addresses both goals using techniques from machine learning,      supplemented by more traditional computer-assisted text analysis.
[2]It is important to mention that this term occurs much more frequently than less offensive      terms like negro* (3351) or positive expressions such as afr.* americ.* (230) in this sample.
[3]Supervised machine learning is a process for building a classifier from labeled training      data. For example, one might present a learner with two sets of e-mails, identified by human      evaluators as either spam or not spam. The learner generates a statistical model which best      captures this distinction. Following training, the model generated by the learner is used to      classify unseen instances, such as incoming e-mail. Supervised learning is contrasted with      unsupervised learning, which is not based on preidentified class labeled training data. For      example, clustering algorithms use a variety of measures of similarity to assign instances to      groups.
[4] "Features" in this context means the data being used to perform the machine      learning task. Each instance, typically a document or part of a document, may have an arbitrary      number of features which may include word, lemma or word sequence (n-grams) frequencies as well      as other elements of the data which can be computed, such as sentence length or part-of-speech frequencies.
[5]Cross validation is a technique to evaluate the likelihood that the machine learning model      being generated by a learner is "over-fitted" to the training data, which would limit the      effectiveness of the classifier to properly handle unseen instances. Over-fitting will also      tend to weight relatively unrepresentative features too highly. Cross validation is performed      by subdividing the training data into random groups (often 10), training on some of these      groups and evaluating the predictions on the remainder.
[6]Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are commonly used      techniques in the machine learning community. MNB is based on calculating the prior      probabilities of each feature in two or more classes. Thus, "viagra" in an MNB spam filter      would be assigned as very high probability of being in a spam e-mail. For an unseen instance,      the system calculates the probabilities for each feature being a member of a particular class,      adding up all of the probabilities to assign one or more classifications to the new instance.      SVMs are somewhat more complex, as they attempt to divide training data into maximally      separated groups by adjusting feature weights.

[8]The Weka3 system refers to Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) which is one of a number      of heuristics to allow Support Vector Machines to perform reasonably quickly and effectively.
[9]We conducted these experiments using a stand-alone parallelized implementation of the      SVM-Light system [10] with PGPDT [ Zanni et al. 2003 ],      [ Zanni et al. 2006 ] on the University of      Chicago Teraport.
